# Landing Page Project

This is a project to  test my knowledge of JS.
1- I created a navigation bar menu of four buttons using "for loop".
2- I linked these buttons to the different four section in the page using anchor elements.
3- I created a function to clarify in which section we are on by changing the color of the button of the section we are on.
4- I created a function to make the movement to a section "smooth" when press its button for more elegant look.
